	abstract = {Agriculture is under transformation in sub-Saharan Africa where millions still do not have access to a healthy diet. Policy makers in this region should find ways to accelerate agricultural transformation while increasing access to healthy diets. Optimizing agriculture’s public budget stands out as a handy option. By combining a dynamic computable general equilibrium model and a multi-criteria decision-making technique, and applying them in the context of Ethiopia, this paper points to an important trade-off that policy makers should keep in mind. An optimal allocation of agriculture’s public budget aimed at increasing agri-food output, creating off-farm jobs and reducing rural poverty, which are agricultural transformation objectives, will help to reduce the cost of a healthy diet, allowing around 2 million more Ethiopians to afford it. This number could even be higher should policy makers allocate the budget optimally aiming at only lowering the cost of a healthy diet, but at the cost of reducing household income and slowing down transformation.},

	abstract = {Policymakers seek objectives that can be conflicting under a budget constraint. Solving this problem requires a multi-criteria decision-making technique whereby equations of a dynamic computable general equilibrium model are constraints to a policy optimisation problem. We illustrate this approach in the framework of agricultural transformation objectives. Using data for Ethiopia we show the potential conflict between policy objectives and how policies are optimally determined to arrive at the best possible compromise. Should Ethiopian policymakers pursue increasing agri-food GDP, rural household welfare, or agri-food exports, for example, they will not necessarily observe strong trade-offs between these objectives. However, if they invest in different agricultural sectors to achieve such objectives, the way in which they finance the investment will result in macroeconomic trade-offs. Only when the new investment is mostly allocated to oilseeds and coffee will there be not only simultaneous but also maximised improvement in all three policy objectives.},
