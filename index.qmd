The [Policy Optimization Tool's (PolOpT)](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/a9b06566-1128-4032-9c6e-203211f1d288) Emissions Database (EMDB) is an effort of the Monitoring and Analysing Food and Agricultural Policies (MAFAP) programme of the Agrifood Economics and Policy Division (ESA) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which aims to provide a seamless integration of data on anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution with National Accounts data at different levels of aggregation by economic activity for use with environmentally extended structural analysis frameworks like Computable General Equilibrium and Input-Output models. Its main output is the GEARS Database of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution by economic activity.

In addition to the database, EMDB also provides scripting facilities for the integration of different data sources, at different tiers of data availability by country and thorough documentation to abide by the principles of replicability, openness, and transparency.

_**Disclaimer:** While EMDB has been made possible with the support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), this is a work in progress, which has not undergone FAO's rigorous review process and the methodological choices made here do not represent an institutional position of FAO, the Agrifood Economics and Policy Division (ESA), or any other of its instances.
