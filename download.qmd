Here you can download different versions of the PolOpT Emissions Database. 

## Complete Database

We provide annual time series data on emissions of the three main greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) and fluorinated gases per sector, country, and driver where possible, expressed in thousand metric tons CO~2~eq using the  100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP) of the IPCCâ€™s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), in zipped Comma Separated Values (".csv") files, as well as much smaller R dataset files (".rds") for convenience.
